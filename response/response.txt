Interstellar is a mind-bending cinematic piece directed by Christopher Nolan, the same director as Inception. The story unfolds as Earth's resources are rapidly depleting, and mankind needs to find a new home. A group of explorers, including former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), are sent on a mission to traverse a wormhole in space in hopes of finding a new habitable planet. The plot delves into sophisticated concepts of physics and time relativity, and is paired with breathtaking visuals that capture the vastness and mystique of space.

Just like Inception, Interstellar engages the audience in a thought-provoking narrative that is layered with multiple themes and stunning visual effects. Both films play with the concept of reality and test the bounds of human comprehension.
